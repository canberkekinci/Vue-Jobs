# Project Description

This is a Vue.js application where users can browse, add, and manage job listings. For the backend, the project uses **json-server** as a mock API to handle GET and POST requests for jobs.
Itâ€™s designed to simulate a real-world job board application without needing a custom server.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
